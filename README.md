Hospitals face critical challenges in efficiently diagnosing and prioritizing care for patients with heart disease. This project addresses one such challenge, where a hospital urgently needed an expert data scientist to develop a solution that could save lives and reduce costs. The task involves building a machine learning classification model capable of predicting whether a person suffers from heart disease based on key physical features collected upon admission.

Project Highlights:
Objective:
The goal is to create a predictive model to classify individuals into two categoriesâ€”those diagnosed with heart disease and those without it. This model aids in early detection and enables the hospital to allocate resources effectively to patients requiring urgent care.

Data:
The dataset includes primary physical features of patients, such as age, maximum heart rate, and other relevant health metrics. These features serve as input variables to train the model.

Machine Learning Workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations, such as scatter plots, help in understanding the relationships between features (e.g., age and maximum heart rate) and their correlation with heart disease.
Data Splitting:
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's generalizability.
Model Training and Evaluation:
A classification algorithm is trained using the training data, and its performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction:
The trained model predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease, enabling timely intervention.
Impact:
By leveraging machine learning, the hospital can make data-driven decisions, improve patient outcomes, and optimize resource utilization. Early and accurate diagnosis of heart disease can significantly reduce mortality rates and healthcare costs.
